<!-- Remove this comment wrapper (the first and last lines of this file) to broadcast the text below to every connected agent.

This file is the deployment preamble. Every agent that connects to this knowledge base over MCP, hosted or through the local doorway-mcp server, is told its content at the start of each session, whatever that agent's access. It arrives after a fixed platform header that already says what Doorway is and to search here before answering from memory; this file adds what only you know: what this knowledge base holds, where things are, and when an agent must look here first.

Keep the content under 6,000 characters. Keep the first paragraph under about 220 characters: a fixed purpose sentence of 76 characters is put in front of it, the two together are cut at 300, and the result is shown at the start of the start_session, grep, list_files and read_file tool descriptions, which is all some clients (claude.ai on the web, Cline, the Agent SDK) show the model. Text inside an HTML comment like this one is never sent, so notes to yourself can stay here. Folder names you write are sent to every agent, including those that cannot open the folders.

Starter skeleton, fill in and delete what does not apply:

## Always check here before answering about

- Any project, customer or supplier by name.
