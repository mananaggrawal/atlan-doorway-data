# How to get started

Welcome. This workspace is your team's shared home for three things:

- **Knowledge**: documents your team writes and trusts, organised however
  suits you.
- **Skills**: step-by-step instructions your AI agents follow to do real work.
- **Tools**: the integrations those agents are allowed to call, with the
  credentials kept safe.

Everything lives in a git repository your team owns, so every change has an
author, a history, and a way back.

## Find your way around

Use the app switcher in the top-left corner to move between the two views:

- **Knowledge** is the reading and writing surface: a file tree on the left,
  the document on the right.
- **Skills & Tools** is the library: plugins holding skills and tools, who runs
  them, and what still needs setting up.

## Write your first document

Open Knowledge, pick a folder (or create one), and start a page. If you can
edit a file directly, an **Edit** button appears; if the page belongs to
someone else, you get **Propose changes** instead. A proposal becomes a
**change request**: the owner sees exactly what you want to change, and
nothing moves until they approve it. That is the whole safety model, and it
applies to agents exactly as it applies to people.

## Set up your plugin

In Skills & Tools, use **New plugin** to make a place for your team. Creating
a plugin makes you the one who runs it: you approve its change requests,
answer join requests, and manage who can see what (the **Share** button on
the plugin page). Skills you create outside any plugin land in your own private
space and can move into a plugin later.

## Give your agents skills and tools

- On a plugin page, **+** adds a skill: name it and an empty skill file opens,
  ready for instructions. Write it the way you would brief a careful new
  colleague: what to load, what to do, what to record.
- Tools live in the plugin too: most are small manual files, and MCP servers
  go in the plugin's `mcp.json`. Sign-ins and keys are entered on the
  **Connect** page or the tool's own page, never written into files.

## Connect your AI agent

Open the profile menu and choose **External agent access** to mint a
connection key, then follow the instructions there to add this workspace to
your agent (Claude Code and other MCP-capable agents work). The agent sees
exactly what you can see and can do exactly what you can do, nothing more.

## Good to know

- The repo root's `AGENTS.md` is the full reference your agents read. It is
  maintained by the platform, so leave it as it is; team conventions belong in
  documents like this one.
- Nothing is ever really lost: every version of every file stays in the
  repository's history.

Delete this page once your team has found its feet, or keep it for the next
person who joins.
